## 1. Document Overview

### Purpose
This Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) provides end-to-end traceability from business objectives through implementation to testing validation. It ensures all business requirements are addressed and can be verified through testing.

### Scope
- Business requirements from BRD Section 3 (Goals & Objectives)
- Functional requirements from BRD Section 6
- Data sources and analytics requirements from BRD Section 15
- Dashboard components from actual implementation
- Test cases from UAT script

### Traceability Levels
1. **Business Requirement** → Functional Requirement
2. **Functional Requirement** → Data Source
3. **Data Source** → Dashboard Component
4. **Dashboard Component** → Test Case
5. **Test Case** → Acceptance Criteria
