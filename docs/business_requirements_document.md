## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the business and analytics requirements for optimizing the emergency procurement and logistics performance management process within a multinational military logistics framework. The current emergency request handling lacks automation and real-time visibility. Additionally, key performance metrics around vendor performance, inventory risks, and budget execution are fragmented across spreadsheets and emails.

This specification provides a roadmap for digitalizing emergency workflows and integrating operational dashboards to improve logistics responsiveness, accountability, and readiness.

## 2. Scope

### In Scope
- Digital handling of emergency procurement requests  
- Integration with base inventory and budget systems  
- A centralized dashboard for operational monitoring and leadership reporting  
- Exportable reports and root cause summaries
- Real-time vendor performance tracking
- Budget variance monitoring and alerts

### Out of Scope
- Routine (non-emergency) procurement workflows
- Strategic procurement planning (>90 days)
- Personnel management systems
- Equipment maintenance tracking
- Financial accounting systems beyond budget monitoring

---

## 3. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Reduce emergency supply response time by 30%  
- Digitally track emergency requests from initiation to fulfillment  
- Enable real-time prioritization based on supply risk  
- Consolidate performance KPIs into a command-level dashboard  
- Ensure continuity of supplies across bases

### Secondary Objectives
- Improve vendor accountability through SLA tracking
- Enhance budget visibility and control
- Reduce manual errors in procurement processes
- Enable data-driven decision making for logistics planning
