# Emergency Request Fulfillment Process (Simulated)

## Phase 1: Request Initiation
- Logistics Officer at base identifies stock issue (data: `base_inventory_supply.csv`)
- Triggers emergency request with priority classification (data: `supply_orders.csv`)
- **Risk factors assessed:** Route security level, current inventory days remaining

## Phase 2: Approval & Prioritization
- High-priority flagged for review (simulated by "Emergency" priority)
- Command validates route risk + inventory levels
- **Budget authorization** checked against allocated funds (`supply_budget.csv`)

## Phase 3: Procurement Execution
- Procurement team places order to vendor based on availability and performance history
- Track via `expected_delivery_date` in `supply_orders.csv`
- **Route planning** considers `route_risk_level` for transport security

## Phase 4: Delivery & Tracking
- Compare `actual_delivery_date` to expected
- Delays calculated in `supply_deliveries.csv`
- **Real-time monitoring** of shipment status and route conditions

## Phase 5: Inventory Update
- Once delivered, inventory updated (simplified in this prototype)
- **Quality verification** and stock reconciliation
- Update `last_updated` timestamp in inventory records

## Phase 6: Performance Monitoring
- KPIs calculated: lead time, vendor SLA, base risk index, budget variance
- **Lessons learned** captured for process improvement
- **Vendor performance** ratings updated for future procurement decisions

## Phase 7: Process Performance Analysis

### Current State Metrics
- **Manual Request Processing Time:** 4-6 hours (email → approval → vendor contact)
- **Data Fragmentation Impact:** 2+ hours daily aggregating reports across systems
- **Emergency Response Bottleneck:** 24-48 hour approval cycles

### Identified Inefficiencies
- **Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys):**
  - Why are emergency requests delayed? → Manual approval routing
  - Why manual routing? → No standardized request interface
  - Why no interface? → Each base uses different systems
  - Why different systems? → Legacy procurement processes
  - Why legacy processes? → No centralized data architecture

### Process Improvement Opportunities
- **Automation Potential:** 70% of routine approvals could be automated
- **Data Integration:** Single dashboard eliminates 15+ manual reports
- **Standardization:** Unified request form reduces processing errors by 40%

## Phase 8: Process Flow Comparison

### Current State (As-Is):
Request → Email → Manual Review → Phone Calls → Excel Tracking → Vendor Contact → Manual Updates

### Future State (To-Be):
Request Form → Auto-Routing → Dashboard Review → Digital Approval → System Tracking → Performance Analytics

**Time Savings:** 4-6 hours → 30 minutes per emergency request
